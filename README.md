## Description

Classes designed for physical implementation as well as simulated implementation of an ad-hoc network on a single decentralized subnet.

## Dependencies

### Install the pcap library

Run 'sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev' in terminal to install the library.

## Running the code

This codebase is organized into several 'modules'. Modules are code grouped in a subdirectory of the main directory. Each module has been developed with a built in test framework and is compiled into a static library (.a) file for linking capabilities. 

### Testing Modules

Each module has a 'test.cc' file used for testing. Use the following tests to test a module: 

1. Navigate to the module directory in a terminal
2. Type 'make clean'
3. Type 'make'
4. Type './test'

The tests for this module should run. PASS indicates the test passed and FAIL indicates that the test failed. 

## Modules Overview

### ADHOC

Infrastructure for providing ad-hoc communication. 
[code here](adhoc)

### HARDWARE

Hardware interfacing for components of ad-hoc routing.
[code here](hardware)

### SIMULATION

Simulation interfacing for components of ad-hoc routing.

### AODV 

AODV Protocol implemented from AODV RFC3561 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3561.txt).
[code here](aodv)

### HELLO_MONITOR

Hello messages to provide primitive network monitoring of one hop neighbors. 
[code here](hello_monitor)

### REM

Implementation of REgression-based network Monitoring (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3360774.3360795)

### SOCKET

UDP Sockets and helper classes.

## To-Do
- Completely redo the file system and makefiles to use dependencies and actually use the static libraries, the Makefiles currently are awful
  - Use hidden directories to store build files and dependency files
  - Use structures in each file system to hold src (.cc) and include (.h)
  - Make sure all include paths are not relative ("../rssi/")
  - Use -L -l to link the static libraries
  - Figure out how to avoid recompiling every file every time we make
- Fully doxygen document the code base
- Unify the Style to use one style guideline
- Create stoppable threads
