{
	// real inputs: int sc1_ID, int sc2_ID, double time, bool unitFlag

	int sc2_ID = 1; 
	float time = 45123.1; 
	bool unitFlag = 0;


	// This function needs "sc_orbits.txt" to run

	// Steps of how to determine line of sight.
	// 1. open .txt file with sc orbit info
	// 2. read in the timestep size, number of s/c, and number of timesteps
	// 3. find the iteration number corresponding to the input time
	// 4. pull the cartesian coordinates from .txt orbit file for each s/c. Interpolate between timesteps
	// 5. if unitFlag = true, then scale down orbit distances to drone distances
	// 6. with the position vector for both s/c 1 and s/c 2, run algorithm. As of 10/1/2019, using spherical approximation for asteroid
	// 7. return: true (s/c can see each other) or false (no line of sight)
	// Friendly Reminder: s/c and sc are abbreviations for spacecraft and can refer to any satellite, including the carrier
	// Algorithm in Step 6 is from JPL's code and is based off of this website: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Point-LineDistance3-Dimensional.html
	
	// Define some constants
	double asteroid_radius = 16.84;			// asteroid radius [km] using spherical approximation (mean radius obtained from wikipedia)

	// Step 1:
	ifstream input_file;
	input_file.open("sc_orbits.txt");		// open file to read orbital positions of all s/c and other info

	// Step 2:
	int tStepSize;		// size of timestep [seconds]
	int num_sc, numTimeSteps;
	input_file >> num_sc;
	input_file >> tStepSize;
	input_file >> numTimeSteps;
	cout << "Number of S/C: " << num_sc << ", " << "Timestep size: " << tStepSize << ", " << "Number of timesteps: " << numTimeSteps << endl;
	

	// Step 3:
	// The time passed to this function will not be exactly equal to one of the timesteps. It will always fall somewhere in between two timesteps
	// Because of this, linear interpolation is used to estimate the position between the timesteps
	// To clarify, let t=time input to function. Let t_1 be the time less than t and t_2 be the time greater than t such that t_1 <= t < t_2
	// Knowing the size of the timestep (i.e. how "big" the step is), the timestep (or iteration or entry) corresponding to t_1 can be found:
	int timeStep_Below = time / tStepSize;		// timestep corresponding to t_1
	int timeStep_Above = timeStep_Below + 1;	// timestep corresponding to t_2
	int t_1 = timeStep_Below * tStepSize;		// t_1
	int t_2 = timeStep_Above * tStepSize;		// t_2


	// Step 4:
		// Position vectors have the following format:
			// r[0] = x coordinate
			// r[1] = y coordinate
			// r[2] = z coordinate
		// position vectors for s/c 1 and 2. units of km
		double r1[3]; // = { 0.5, 0.5, 0 };
		double r2[3]; // = { 0.5, 0.4, 0 };

		// these are temporary vectors for storing info from the txt file and performing interpolation
		double temp1[3];	// will store position for timestep before input time.	This corresponds to t_1
		double temp2[3];	// will store position for timestep after input time.	This corresponds to t_2
		
		// Find line of txt file where the string name of the s/c is. For example, for the carrier, lineHeader = 2, and for the 1st s/c.
		// this is used as a reference to find the position at the correct timestep for each particular s/c

	// Brief algorithm description: 
		// There is a line L that passes through s/c 1 and s/c 2. Also let the center of the asteroid be at the origin.
		// The portion of line L  between s/c 1 and s/c 2 is essentially the "line of sight" line. We are interested in whether a 
		// point in the asteroid lies on this portion of the line L. If even one point does, then there is no LOS. 
		// To determine this, a short algorithm is used. 
		// The first step is to find the point, P, on line L that is closest to the origin.
		// Next, calculate the distance, D, from the asteroid's center (i.e. origin) to the point P.
		// Next, check if point P lies between s/c 1 and s/c 2 (this corresponds to having a t between 0 and 1)
		// If it does, check whether D > asteroid radius. 
		//		If it is, then point P lies outside of the asteroid. The s/c have line of sight to each other
		//		If it isn't, then point P lies inside the asteroid and line of sight is blocked (i.e. no LOS)
		// If point P doesn't lie between the s/c, 
		//      Then there is LOS between the s/c for all practical purposes.
		//		The only way there wouldn't be LOS in this case would be if one or both of the s/c were actually inside the asteroid
		//		which means a s/c crashed and there is a whole lot of other issues.
		// Again, some of the material for this can be found on http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Point-LineDistance3-Dimensional.html
